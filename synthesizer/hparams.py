    # Never use lower batch size than 32 on a single GPU!
    # Same applies for Wavenet: wavenet_batch_size = 8 * N (wavenet_batch_size can be smaller than
    #  8 if GPU is having OOM, minimum 2)
    # Please also apply the synthesis batch size modification likewise. (if N GPUs are used for 
    # synthesis, minimal batch size must be N, minimum of 1 sample per GPU)
    # We did not add an automatic multi-GPU batch size computation to avoid confusion in the 
    # user"s mind and to provide more control to the user for
    # resources related decisions.

    #	Many thanks to @MlWoo for his awesome work on multi-GPU Tacotron which showed to work a

    # Hardware setup: Default supposes user has only one GPU: "/gpu:0" (Tacotron only for now!

    # Audio
    # Audio parameters are the most important parameters to tune when using this work on your 
    # personal data. Below are the beginner steps to adapt
    # this work to your personal data:
    #	1- Determine my data sample rate: First you need to determine your audio sample_rate (how 
	# many samples are in a second of audio). This can be done using sox: "sox --i <filename>"
    #		(For this small tuto, I will consider 24kHz (24000 Hz), and defaults are 22050Hz, 
	# so there are plenty of examples to refer to)
    #	2- set sample_rate parameter to your data correct sample rate
    #	3- Fix win_size and and hop_size accordingly: (Supposing you will follow our advice: 50ms 
	# window_size, and 12.5ms frame_shift(hop_size))
    #		a- win_size = 0.05 * sample_rate. In the tuto example, 0.05 * 24000 = 1200
    #		b- hop_size = 0.25 * win_size. Also equal to 0.0125 * sample_rate. In the tuto 
	# example, 0.25 * 1200 = 0.0125 * 24000 = 300 (Can set frame_shift_ms=12.5 instead)
    #	4- Fix n_fft, num_freq and upsample_scales parameters accordingly.
    #		a- n_fft can be either equal to win_size or the first power of 2 that comes after 
	# win_size. I usually recommend using the latter
    #			to be more consistent with signal processing friends. No big difference to be seen
	#  however. For the tuto example: n_fft = 2048 = 2**11
    #		b- num_freq = (n_fft / 2) + 1. For the tuto example: num_freq = 2048 / 2 + 1 = 1024 + 
	# 1 = 1025.
    #		c- For WaveNet, upsample_scales products must be equal to hop_size. For the tuto 
	# example: upsample_scales=[15, 20] where 15 * 20 = 300
    #			it is also possible to use upsample_scales=[3, 4, 5, 5] instead. One must only 
	# keep in mind that upsample_kernel_size[0] = 2*upsample_scales[0]
    #			so the training segments should be long enough (2.8~3x upsample_scales[0] * 
	# hop_size or longer) so that the first kernel size can see the middle 
    #			of the samples efficiently. The length of WaveNet training segments is under the 
	# parameter "max_time_steps".
    #	5- Finally comes the silence trimming. This very much data dependent, so I suggest trying 
	# preprocessing (or part of it, ctrl-C to stop), then use the
    #		.ipynb provided in the repo to listen to some inverted mel/linear spectrograms. That 
	# will first give you some idea about your above parameters, and
    #		it will also give you an idea about trimming. If silences persist, try reducing 
	# trim_top_db slowly. If samples are trimmed mid words, try increasing it.
    #	6- If audio quality is too metallic or fragmented (or if linear spectrogram plots are 
	# showing black silent regions on top), then restart from step 2.
