# Real-Time Voice Cloning
This repository is an implementation of [Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to
Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04558.pdf) (SV2TTS) with a vocoder that works in real-time. Feel free to check [my thesis](https://matheo.uliege.be/handle/2268.2/6801) if you're curious or if you're looking for info I haven't documented. Mostly I would recommend giving a quick look to the figures beyond the introduction.

SV2TTS is a three-stage deep learning framework that allows to create a numerical representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio, and to use it to condition a text-to-speech model trained to generalize to new voices.

## News
**13/11/19**: I'm now working full time and I will not maintain this repo anymore. To anyone who reads this:
- **If you just want to clone your voice (and not someone else's):** I recommend our free plan on [Resemble.AI](https://www.resemble.ai/). You will get a better voice quality and less prosody errors.
- **If this is not your case:** proceed with this repository, but you might end up being disappointed by the results. If you're planning to work on a serious project, my strong advice: find another TTS repo. Go [here](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/issues/364) for more info.

**20/08/19:** I'm working on [resemblyzer](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer), an independent package for the voice encoder. You can use your trained encoder models from this repo with it.

**06/07/19:** Need to run within a docker container on a remote server? See [here](https://sean.lane.sh/posts/2019/07/Running-the-Real-Time-Voice-Cloning-project-in-Docker/).

**25/06/19:** Experimental support for low-memory GPUs (~2gb) added for the synthesizer. Pass `--low_mem` to `demo_cli.py` or `demo_toolbox.py` to enable it. It adds a big overhead, so it's not recommended if you have enough VRAM.


## Setup

### 1. Install Requirements

**Python 3.6 or 3.7** is needed to run the toolbox.

* Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (>=1.0.1).
* Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#get-packages).
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the remaining necessary packages.

### 2. Download Pretrained Models
Download the latest [here](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/wiki/Pretrained-models).

### 3. (Optional) Test Configuration
Before you download any dataset, you can begin by testing your configuration with:

`python demo_cli.py`

If all tests pass, you're good to go.

### 4. (Optional) Download Datasets
For playing with the toolbox alone, I only recommend downloading [`LibriSpeech/train-clean-100`](https://www.openslr.org/resources/12/train-clean-100.tar.gz). Extract the contents as `<datasets_root>/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100` where `<datasets_root>` is a directory of your choosing. Other datasets are supported in the toolbox, see [here](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/wiki/Training#datasets). You're free not to download any dataset, but then you will need your own data as audio files or you will have to record it with the toolbox.

### 5. Launch the Toolbox
You can then try the toolbox:

`python demo_toolbox.py -d <datasets_root>`  
or  
`python demo_toolbox.py`  

depending on whether you downloaded any datasets. If you are running an X-server or if you have the error `Aborted (core dumped)`, see [this issue](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/issues/11#issuecomment-504733590).
