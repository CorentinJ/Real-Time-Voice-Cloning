# Real-Time Voice Cloning
This repository is an implementation of [Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to
Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04558.pdf) (SV2TTS) with a vocoder that works in real-time. Feel free to check [my thesis](https://matheo.uliege.be/handle/2268.2/6801) if you're curious or if you're looking for info I haven't documented. Mostly I would recommend giving a quick look to the figures beyond the introduction.

SV2TTS is a three-stage deep learning framework that allows to create a numerical representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio, and to use it to condition a text-to-speech model trained to generalize to new voices.

## News
**13/11/19**: I'm now working full time and I will not maintain this repo anymore. To anyone who reads this:
- **If you just want to clone your voice (and not someone else's):** I recommend our free plan on [Resemble.AI](https://www.resemble.ai/). Firstly because you will get a better voice quality and less prosody errors, and secondly because it will not require a complex setup like this repo does.
- **If this is not your case:** proceed with this repository, but be warned: not only is the environment a mess to setup, but you might end up being disappointed by the results. If you're planning to work on a serious project, my strong advice: find another TTS repo. Go [here](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/issues/364) for more info.

**20/08/19:** I'm working on [resemblyzer](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer), an independent package for the voice encoder. You can use your trained encoder models from this repo with it.

**06/07/19:** Need to run within a docker container on a remote server? See [here](https://sean.lane.sh/posts/2019/07/Running-the-Real-Time-Voice-Cloning-project-in-Docker/).

**25/06/19:** Experimental support for low-memory GPUs (~2gb) added for the synthesizer. Pass `--low_mem` to `demo_cli.py` or `demo_toolbox.py` to enable it. It adds a big overhead, so it's not recommended if you have enough VRAM.


## Installation and Setup
